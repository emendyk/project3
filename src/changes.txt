Changes.txt
I could not produce any particular runtime errors in the program from Project 3, 
because the program was simply saving any input from the TextFields to the Labels. 
However, I have offered changes to add requirements to certain TextFields. 
Phone and email could have potential runtime errors (BadNumberException, BadEmailException) 
with the requirements that have been added but I have addressed those issues with the changes.

Errors to address in the program

Email: Make a requirement for a valid email address that looks for an “@” symbol and a top level domain at the end of the email address
Phone: Requirement for a valid phone number of 10 digits only (3333333333)

Result of these changes

When the user clicks the submit button their entries will be saved in the Labels to the left of the TextFields, 
if the entry information is not applicable an error message will be displayed in a pop-up.

Why I did not choose to change Name, Address

Some names and most addresses have both numbers and characters within them. 
It would be difficult for me to determine whether the user entries for these TextFields are valid or not.
